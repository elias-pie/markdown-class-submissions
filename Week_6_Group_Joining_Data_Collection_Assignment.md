## Background
So I was given an assignment to which I needed to poll at least 10-20 peers asking specific questions about the groups they are in and what caused them to join or kept
them from joining groups, to which I created a google form (More technically 2) and put them on my Instagram story. 

## Form Responses
#### Are you in any groups?

## My Take on this information
This information does indeed support and clarify the [learning I did last week](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cf5RbTVVURRku6EavkREAkkhf0pjAB2_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108429976414009121684&rtpof=true&sd=true). This is evident with the source from the [Nobaproject](https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-psychology-of-groups) as this source showed that we seek to be included rather than excluded alongside that groups can provide people with information. This is clearly shown in my data as per the poll. The other source I used from [Libretexts](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Courses/College_of_the_Canyons/COMS_120%3A_Small_Group_Communication_(Osborne)/02%3A_Reading_Group_Development/2.04%3A_Why_People_Join_Groups) states that we need to communicate with other people to meet basic human needs which my data from my poll also shows. Now, about the Gem[^gem_context]. The gem pointed out that we join groups and contribute to the group "for a goal that benefits the entire group will rather make indiviuals care more for he group rather their own self". Now, the statement that individuals will care for the group rather than one self is not exactly stated in the poll, the data from the question "Do you feel you are contributing to something beyond youself by joining or participating in groups?" could show us that, yes, people do think that they participate in groups beyond themselves, but not exactly caring about the group more than the individual. The religion question was added to hopefully get a majority of praticing religion and to get some reasoning out of it, however, majority of the responses said no, they do not participate in a religion This all goes to show that my learning from last week is backed up here.
